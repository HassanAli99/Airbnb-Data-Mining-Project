Airbnb Data Mining Project
Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform a data mining analysis of the Airbnb listings dataset in order to gain insights into the market and predict the price of listings based on various features. The following sections of the project outline will explain what CRISP-DM is and why it is important, apply the CRISP-DM process to the Airbnb dataset, and outline the various steps involved in the data mining process.

Outline
Explanation of CRISP-DM
Analysis of Airbnb Dataset using CRISP-DM process
a. Exploratory Data Analysis
i. How many listings are available in the neighborhood?
ii. When are the prices high and low?
iii. What is the area with most listings?
iv. How is the price distributed in the areas?
v. Is there a pattern in the listings? Is there a professional listing that operates a big number of listings, which might suggest commercialization.
b. Price Prediction
i. Build a model to predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on features such as number of rooms, location, and more.
c. Advance Price Prediction (Future Work)
i. Add more features such as proximity to a bus stop, underground, and park.
ii. Geographic Weighted Regression vs Normal Regression.
CRISP-DM
The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely-used framework for conducting data mining projects. It was introduced by Goretzki and Wirth in a paper titled "A Standard for Data Mining" (Goretzki & Wirth, 2000). The CRISP-DM process consists of the following six steps:

Business Understanding: In this step, the business objectives of the data mining project are defined and the problem to be solved is clearly stated. This step also involves defining the success criteria for the project.
Data Understanding: In this step, the data that will be used for the project is analyzed in order to gain a better understanding of the variables, distributions, and relationships between variables. This step also involves identifying any data quality issues that may need to be addressed.
Data Preparation: In this step, the data is transformed, cleaned, and prepared for analysis. This may involve removing missing or duplicate data, transforming variables, and dealing with outliers.
Modeling: In this step, statistical and machine learning models are developed and tested in order to determine which model best meets the business objectives defined in the first step.
Evaluation: In this step, the model selected in the modeling step is evaluated to determine its effectiveness in solving the problem and meeting the success criteria defined in the first step.
Deployment: In this step, the model is deployed and put into production in order to deliver the desired results. This step may involve integrating the model into an existing system or building a new system to deliver the results.
The CRISP-DM process is a flexible and iterative framework that can be adapted to fit the needs of different data mining projects. By following the steps of the CRISP-DM process, data scientists can ensure that their projects are well-structured, clearly defined, and effectively delivered to meet business objectives (Goretzki & Wirth, 2000).
