# Introduction

** Still Working on this project**

The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis of the Airbnb listings dataset, as well as build a model to predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on certain features. This project will follow the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, which is a widely-used and flexible process for conducting data mining projects.

## Outline
1. Explanation of CRISP-DM and its importance
2. Application of CRISP-DM to the Airbnb Dataset
   - How many listings are available in the neighborhood?
   - When are the prices high and low?
   - Which neighborhoods are considered safe for hosting?
   - Long-term rentals instead of leasing?
   - Presence of professional hosting service providers?

## CRISP-DM

CRISP-DM is a process for conducting data mining projects that consists of six steps:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

The CRISP-DM process is designed to ensure that data mining projects are well-structured, clearly defined, and effectively delivered to meet business objectives.
